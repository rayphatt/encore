## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start development servers (frontend and backend together):
   ```bash
   npm run dev:all
   ```
   
   > **Note for PowerShell users:** The '&&' operator does not work in PowerShell. The 'dev:all' script uses a cross-platform solution and should work in all shells.

3. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
